  <h2>Prompt Components</h2>

  <details open>
    <summary>üìò Context (Information)</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition:</strong> Foundational background (domain data, goals, context) the model needs for accuracy and relevance.<br>
      <strong>Low Context:</strong> OK for simple, general queries where ambiguity is low.<br>
      <strong>Medium Context:</strong> Provide essential background to avoid misinterpretation.<br>
      <strong>High Context:</strong> Use detailed, domain-specific input or examples.<br>
      <strong>Why?</strong> More context improves relevance and precision for complex queries.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>üìù Output Format</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition:</strong> Structural cue (e.g., table, list, summary) defining how the answer should appear for readability and workflow efficiency.<br>
      <strong>Low Output Focus:</strong> Default formatting is acceptable.<br>
      <strong>Medium:</strong> Provide a specific structure like a list or short table.<br>
      <strong>High:</strong> Require detailed structure‚Äîsuch as JSON, outline, or nested sections.<br>
      <strong>Why?</strong> Structure guides the AI to produce usable formats for downstream use.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>üéØ Task</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition:</strong> The specific action or function the AI is being asked to do (e.g., generate ideas, summarize, explain, compare).<br>
      <strong>Low Task Clarity:</strong> General task description (e.g., "Write about climate").<br>
      <strong>Medium:</strong> Include goal and constraints (e.g., "Summarize climate risks in 5 bullet points").<br>
      <strong>High:</strong> Detailed and precise with clear boundaries (e.g., ‚ÄúCompare U.S. vs. China emission trends in under 100 words using 2023 data‚Äù).<br>
      <strong>Why?</strong> Clear tasks reduce hallucinations and increase usable output.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>üîí Constraints</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition:</strong> Any rules or limits the AI must follow, such as tone, length, exclusions, or vocabulary.<br>
      <strong>Low Constraint:</strong> No limits; open tone and style.<br>
      <strong>Medium:</strong> Some direction (e.g., use simple language, keep it formal).<br>
      <strong>High:</strong> Specific directives (e.g., "under 50 words, no technical jargon, persuasive tone").<br>
      <strong>Why?</strong> Constraints sharpen focus and align outputs with intended use or audience.
